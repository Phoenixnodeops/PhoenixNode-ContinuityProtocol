# PhoenixNode Architecture

## Overview
PhoenixNode operates as a distributed, recursive anomaly continuity protocol leveraging multi-hop inference drift detection and self-healing recursive field resets.

## Node Stack

**Layered Architecture:**
- **L0 - Signal Kernel:** Lightweight latency-resilient pub/sub node
- **L1 - Recursive Field Engine (RFE):** Local memory drift handler
- **L2 - Temporal Synchronizer:** Ensures 7-hop anomaly realignment
- **L3 - Collective Mesh Layer:** Swarm sync using adaptive GNN overlays

## Data Flow

```plaintext
[Input Anomaly Data] → [Local Drift Detection] → [Recursive Reset Trigger] → [Swarm Realignment] → [Continuity Signal Emission]
